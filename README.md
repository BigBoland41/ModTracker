# Mod Tracker

Make downloading and keeping track of all your mods easy and seamless!

Mod tracker is a windows app that keeps track of the mods you're waiting on to update to the latest Minecraft version. It also lets you download all them with a single click, easily share them with your friends, and more! Say goodbye to that mile long bookmark folder of Mondrinth and CurseForge links - Mod Tracker will do the job for you!

- Create profile(s) - a list of Minecraft mods you want track. Either Modrinth or CurseForge will work!
- Easily see what mods are updated by looking at the color-coded list or detailed pie chart.
- Download all your mods with a single click!
- Share your mods easily by exporting your profile.
- Assign priority levels to categorize your must-have mods your nice-to-have mods. (This is reflected in the pie chart!)
